# Flashcard App 

## Description
This web-based flashcard application provides an intuitive interface for efficient and personalized learning. Users can import their custom flashcards in JSON format or use the provided premade Japanese vocabulary cards. The app supports flexible interaction: tap or press the spacebar to reveal answers, swipe up (or press the Up key) to remove a card if youâ€™ve mastered it, and swipe down (or press the Down key) to revisit the card after 30 seconds for reinforcement.

The app tracks your progress, allowing you to export remaining flashcards for continued study later. This feature makes it perfect for learners who prefer to break down their learning into manageable sessions.
